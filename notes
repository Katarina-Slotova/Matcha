- started working by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

- installed PostreSQL on my laptop from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- created basic db structure; don't know yet how to create the db itself automatically with PostgreSQL
- created basic server configuration:
	- installed node for backend (npm init)
	- installed express (npm install express) for backend
	- installed dotenv (npm install dotenv) for backend, in order to be able to use environment variables (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv - usage instructions are here, but also in the tutorial)
	- install nodemon to automatically monitor any changes in server.js (npm install nodemon)
- make a test home page on localhost with mock data in json format
- make a test signup page on localhost with mock data in json format
- make a test page for finding one specific user on localhost with mock data in json format
- make a put request for modifying user's data
- make a delete request for deleteing a user
- add middleware express.json() in order to save the data sent in post request into "body" & convert it to JS object

- install node-postgres library that enables connecting to postgres db (npm install pg)
- then just follow the usage instructions here: https://node-postgres.com/guides/async-express
- instructions on connecting (use either hardcoded values or use env variables; prefered way is using env variables): https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting
- modified requests in server.js, so that they match syntax for postgres queries

- started client-side by creating basic React setup
- added Bootstrap for styling: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/
- added FontAwesome for icons: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome (copied the first link)
- install react router (npm install react-router-dom)
- install react-bootstrap (npm install react-bootstrap)
- install react-router-bootstrap (npm install react-router-bootstrap)
- installed also fontawesome for icons, but for some reason the icons don't show up (instructions here: https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/react/)
