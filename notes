- started working by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

- installed PostreSQL on my laptop from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- install POSTRGES ON SCHOOL'S MAC with BREW: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Homebrew
- BASIC POSTGRES COMMANDS (useful source to learn about postgres: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/):
	- list all the databases: \l
	- create db: CREATE DATABASE name_of_db;
	- connect to db: \c name_of_db;
	- list all the tables in db: \d
	- see the columns of specific table: \d name_of_table;
	- modify a table by adding a column: ALTER TABLE name_of_table ADD COLUMN name_of_new_column data_type;
	- modify a table by removing a column: ALTER TABLE name_of_table DROP COLUMN name_of_new_column;
 
- created basic db structure; don't know yet how to create the db itself automatically with PostgreSQL
- created basic server configuration:
	- installed node for backend (npm init)
	- installed express (npm install express) for backend
	- installed dotenv (npm install dotenv) for backend, in order to be able to use environment variables (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv - usage instructions are here, but also in the tutorial)
	- install nodemon to automatically monitor any changes in server.js (npm install nodemon)
- make a test home page on localhost with mock data in json format
- make a test signup page on localhost with mock data in json format
- make a test page for finding one specific user on localhost with mock data in json format
- make a put request for modifying user's data
- make a delete request for deleteing a user
- add middleware express.json() in order to save the data sent in post request into "body" & convert it to JS object

- install node-postgres library that enables connecting to postgres db (npm install pg)
- then just follow the usage instructions here: https://node-postgres.com/guides/async-express
- instructions on connecting (use either hardcoded values or use env variables; prefered way is using env variables): https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting
- modified requests in server.js, so that they match syntax for postgres queries

- started client-side by creating basic React setup

2. Create a get request to get one user: http://localhost:3005/users/2
3. Create a post request to create a user: http://localhost:3005/signup
{
    "firstname": "Fast",

    "username": "ChillinChiller",
    "email": "sloth@chill.io",
    "city": "Zootropolis",
    "country": "Wonderland",
    "password": "chill_the_heck_out",
    "image": "sloth.jpg",
    "age": "100",
    "gender": "sloth",

- modify style.css (parts that relate to signup and settings pages)
- change sexual orinatation to gender interest
PORT=3005

PGUSER=postgres 
PGHOST=localhost
PGPASSWORD=123456
PGDATABASE=matchadb
PGPORT=5432

- install react tinder card: npm i react-tinder-card; for proper function it is necessary to install also spring-react: npm i @react-spring/web
- create user cards with photos and user info

- create and style chat area

- install bcrypt for hashing passwords: npm install bcrypt
- connect frontend to backend
- user account creation working
- checking whether email or username already exists does not work yet
- slightly modified users table in db

- install react cookie for frontend: npm install react-cookie
- cookies created upon signup and log in
- login works when connected to db
- updating user's settings work, db is updated accordingly
- get one single user by id (id obtained from cookies) -> not working, query returning rowCount 0

- issue with getting one user still not resolved (showing user undefinied)
- clear cookies upon logout
- get username in navbar

- tried to add selecting potential matches by gender interest of the logged in user but it's not working,
cannot get the gender_interest of the logged in user, so it's not possible to filter the potential matches
